		<td>Daily or weekly timed walks are beneficial in assisting to relieve 
    stress. Walking with your back straight and letting your arms naturally 
  swing as you walk are some ways to ensure that you allow your body to 
distress. Over time, one can increase their distance of walking or work on 
increasing the speed of their walk.</td>
		<td>Dance is exercise, and exercise is a natural remedy for reducing stress. 
    Most experts agree that exercise, connecting with friends, and relaxation 
  are all key components to beating stress naturally.</td>
		<td>Yoga is a form of relaxation that helps to calm the body, mind, and 
    control breathing. This form of exercising is peaceful when performed in a 
  space that is free of distractions. You can choose to position yourself in 
any way that suits your comfort. Set a timer for each position and  work 
through taking deep breaths in and out.</td>
