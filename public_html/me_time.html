		<td>According to the University of Nevada Ren’s counseling services 
		department, different speeds of music create different emotions. Faster 
	music can make you feel alert and concentrate better. Upbeat music can make 
you feel more optimistic and a slower tempo can relax your muscles and make you 
feel soothed.</td>
		<td>When feeling overwhelmed, messages and looking good can boost someone’s 
		mood and confidence. The near-hour experience can reduce the stress a 
	person is experiencing due to the relaxed environment. Using products like 
eucalyptus and&sol; or peppermint Epsom salt can add to the stress relief.</td>
		<td>Sometimes you just need to sit and watch your favorite shows. You do 
		not need to be doing physical activities. When you are watching a show or 
	a movie, your mind is more focused on the plot of the story that you 
temporarily forget everything outside of the storyline.</td>
