<h1 class="main_header">Power Naps</h1>
<p>Naps are essential in relieving stress, especially if you are someone with 
a busy schedule. Power naps allow your body and brain to process and recover 
all the information absorbed throughout the time you were awake. Naps help to 
increase one's alertness, thinking, and performance.</p>
<p>Depending on how much pressure we are under, mental and physical performance 
  starts to decline after 2 to 4 hours. Often thereâ€™s only enough time in our 
  stressful day for a coffee or a little exercise in the fresh air. But a short 
  break to sleep or at least lie down would be the ideal option, as this 
  regenerates the whole body.</p>
<h2>Ways to Prepare for Your Powered Naps &colon;</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Start off by arranging the place you want to rest your body, comfy and 
    relaxing. This can be done by making your bed or whatever surface you 
  choose to lay down your body on. Have the room you are going to rest in be 
scented with a nice relaxing scent to help you feel relaxed.</li>
		<li>Set a timer and put on relaxing soft background noise like rainfall or 
    soothing piano noise to help calm your mind and body.</li>
		<li>Taking a minimum of 30 to 90 minutes of a nap throughout the day will 
    get you the boost of energy needed to keep you moving and relieve the 
  tension in your body and a load of emotions stored throughout.</li>
