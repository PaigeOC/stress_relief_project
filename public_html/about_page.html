<h2>Purpose&colon;</h2>
<p>The purpose of our organization is to help give individuals the resources 
and tools necessary to cope with stressors that are a result of school, work, 
and/or other personal and life matters. Exercising for many has been utilized 
as a way to help reduce stress and to promote a long and healthy lifestyle. 
There are numerous ways one can exercise that does not require intense force 
or energy. One does not necessarily need to be athletic or physically fit to 
partake in exercise activities that are beneficial in ways of reducing stress 
through a boost of endorphins. Endorphins are hormones that have effects on 
your brain in ways of reducing pain and increasing feelings of happiness. Some 
ways that our organization promotes and assists our clients with distress is 
through guided walks, dance, and yoga exercises that are led by professionals.
