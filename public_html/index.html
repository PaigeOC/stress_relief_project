<h3 id="newspaperhead">Unstressing News</h3>
<h4>16 September 2021</h4> 
<p>On this week’s edition of “Unwind from Stress,” we are taking a look at 
harmful ways to destress. Our organization focuses on positive ways to deal 
with stress. Not everyone has the resources and access to some of the coping 
mechanisms that we talk about.</p> 
<p>These are some simple, free and easy ways to clear your mind. One of the 
most beneficial activities for physical and mental health is walking. Walking 
at least thirty minutes a day increases the health of your lungs and heart, 
reduces the risk of a stroke and heart attack, and releases  endorphins which 
is responsible for improving your mood and stimulates relaxation. During your 
walk, you can listen to music and plan ahead for your day and/or week. There 
are no restrictions  on what you can do.</p>
<p>Yoga is another great way to relax your mind and body. Focus your mind on 
keeping your balance and breathing.  Yoga has the same benefits as walking. 
You can do yoga indoors or outdoors. The pace of yoga is much slower and it 
focuses on breathing and posture.</p>
